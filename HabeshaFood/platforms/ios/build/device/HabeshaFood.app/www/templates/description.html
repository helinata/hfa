        People from Ethiopia and Eritrea are called Habesha. Habeshas typical meal consists of injera and several kinds of wot (stew).
        This cuisine consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of wot (sauce) served
        on top of injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out
        of fermented teff flour. Injera is used to scoop up a variety of spicy stews and salads found on any plate. 
        Habesha people eat with their hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entrées
        and side dishes. </p>
